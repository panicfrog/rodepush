# RodePush Requirements

## Introduction

RodePush is a React Native CodePush solution built with Rust, designed to provide efficient app bundle packaging, differential updates, and distribution. The project consists of three main components: a CLI tool for packaging and uploading bundles, a server for generating and distributing differential packages, and a shared core module providing common functionality like bundle splitting.

## Requirements

### 1. Core Module (rodepush-core)

**User Story**: As a developer using RodePush components, I want a shared core module that provides common functionality, so that both CLI and server can reuse critical operations without code duplication.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. System SHALL provide a bundle splitting/chunking mechanism
2. System SHALL provide bundle compression algorithms
3. System SHALL provide cryptographic hashing for bundle integrity
4. System SHALL provide file system utilities for bundle handling
5. System SHALL provide serialization/deserialization for bundle metadata
6. System SHALL expose a stable API for both CLI and server components
7. System SHALL handle bundle format validation
8. System SHALL provide error handling utilities with standardized error types
9. System SHALL provide asset management for React Native resources including diff and compression

### 2. CLI Tool (rodepush-cli)

**User Story**: As a React Native developer, I want a command-line tool to package and upload my app bundles, so that I can easily deploy updates to my applications.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. System SHALL accept React Native project directory as input
2. System SHALL build JavaScript bundles from React Native source code
3. System SHALL compress bundles for efficient transfer
4. System SHALL generate bundle metadata including version, dependencies, and checksums
5. System SHALL upload bundles to the RodePush server via HTTP API
6. System SHALL support authentication with the server using API keys or tokens
7. System SHALL provide progress feedback during upload operations
8. System SHALL validate bundle integrity before upload
9. System SHALL support configuration via command-line arguments and configuration files
10. System SHALL provide verbose logging options for debugging
11. System SHALL handle network failures with retry mechanisms
12. System SHALL support multiple deployment environments (staging, production)
13. System SHALL verify upload success and provide confirmation

### 3. Server (rodepush-server)

**User Story**: As a system administrator, I want a server that can generate differential packages and serve them to client applications, so that end users receive efficient updates with minimal download sizes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. System SHALL receive and store uploaded bundles from CLI
2. System SHALL generate differential packages between bundle versions
3. System SHALL serve differential packages via HTTP API to client applications
4. System SHALL authenticate CLI uploads using API keys or tokens
5. System SHALL authenticate client applications requesting updates
6. System SHALL track bundle versions and deployment history
7. System SHALL provide rollback capabilities to previous bundle versions
8. System SHALL implement rate limiting for API endpoints
9. System SHALL log all operations for auditing and debugging
10. System SHALL provide health check endpoints for monitoring
11. System SHALL handle storage of bundles with configurable backends (filesystem, cloud storage)
12. System SHALL optimize differential package generation for minimal size
13. System SHALL cache generated differential packages for performance
14. System SHALL support multiple application targets and environments
15. System SHALL provide metrics on bundle downloads and deployment success
16. System SHALL validate bundle integrity on upload
17. System SHALL handle concurrent requests safely

### 4. Client Integration

**User Story**: As a React Native app user, I want automatic updates to be downloaded and applied seamlessly, so that I always have the latest features and bug fixes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. System SHALL provide a React Native SDK for client integration
2. System SHALL check for updates periodically or on app launch
3. System SHALL download only differential packages when available
4. System SHALL apply updates without requiring app store updates
5. System SHALL handle update failures gracefully with fallback mechanisms
6. System SHALL provide callback hooks for update lifecycle events
7. System SHALL support staged rollouts and A/B testing scenarios
8. System SHALL verify update integrity before application
9. System SHALL support offline mode with cached updates

### 5. Security and Reliability

**User Story**: As a security-conscious developer, I want all bundle transfers and storage to be secure, so that my application code and user data remain protected.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. System SHALL encrypt bundles during transit using TLS/HTTPS
2. System SHALL verify bundle integrity using cryptographic checksums
3. System SHALL implement secure authentication for all API endpoints
4. System SHALL protect against common vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, etc.)
5. System SHALL implement proper input validation and sanitization
6. System SHALL provide audit logging for security events
7. System SHALL support bundle signing for additional verification
8. System SHALL implement secure storage of sensitive configuration data

### 6. Performance and Scalability

**User Story**: As a platform operator, I want the system to handle high loads efficiently, so that it can serve updates to many applications and users simultaneously.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. System SHALL optimize differential package size through efficient algorithms
2. System SHALL implement caching strategies for frequently requested packages
3. System SHALL support horizontal scaling of server instances
4. System SHALL minimize memory usage during bundle processing
5. System SHALL provide configurable resource limits
6. System SHALL implement efficient storage and retrieval of bundles
7. System SHALL optimize network bandwidth usage
8. System SHALL support CDN integration for global distribution

### 7. Monitoring and Operations

**User Story**: As an operations team member, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging, so that I can ensure system reliability and troubleshoot issues quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. System SHALL provide structured logging with configurable levels
2. System SHALL expose metrics for monitoring tools (Prometheus, etc.)
3. System SHALL implement health check endpoints
4. System SHALL provide configuration management capabilities
5. System SHALL support backup and restore operations
6. System SHALL implement graceful shutdown procedures
7. System SHALL provide diagnostic tools for troubleshooting
8. System SHALL support database migrations and schema updates

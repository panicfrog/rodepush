## Task Execution Notes

Each task should be implemented with:
- Comprehensive unit tests written before implementation (TDD approach)
- Integration tests for cross-component functionality
- Error handling for all failure scenarios
- Performance considerations for production workloads
- Security validation where applicable
- Documentation for public APIs and configuration options

Tasks build incrementally, with each step providing a foundation for subsequent tasks. The implementation prioritizes core functionality first, then adds advanced features like caching, monitoring, and optimization.
